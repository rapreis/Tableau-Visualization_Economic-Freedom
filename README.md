<h2 id="data">Economic Freedom</h2>

The starting point of the visualization is the book "The Road to Serfdom" by Friedrich von Hayek. 
Von Hayek was a theorist of neoliberalism and one of the most important representatives of the Austrian School of economics. 
Hayek's core idea is that government intervention in the economy leads to a restriction of individual freedom, lower economic performance, and lower prosperity in the long run. 
The primary goal is to verify and visualize this core idea using current data.
After the development based on the CRISP-DM process model, the core idea of Hayek should be communicated to the target group and its topicality should be emphasized.

The following datasets are used for this purpose:
- Index of Economic Freedom (<a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/report" target="_blank">Heritage Foundation</a>)
- GDP per capita of selected countries in US dollars (<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD" target="_blank">World Bank Group</a>)
- GDP of selected countries in US dollars (<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD" target="_blank">World Bank Group</a>)
- World Innovation Index (<a href="https://www.wipo.int/web-publications/global-innovation-index-2024/en/gii-2024-results.html" target="_blank">World Intellectual Property Organization</a>)
